## Hello, welcome to my blog!

- I'm Xiaoke Huang, an undergraduate from BNU CS.
- I'm exploring Deep Learning & ~~Face Recognition~~ Model Quantization right now. They both fascinate me a lot!
- I like participating in programming contests! (Though I'm far from being an expert)
- ~~Now I'm learning CS231n~~ Done! Check my [solutions](https://github.com/xk-huang/cs231n-assignment-note) here :tada:
