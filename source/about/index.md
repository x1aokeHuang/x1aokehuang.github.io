## Hello, welcome to my blog!

- I'm Xiaoke Huang, a undergraduate from BNU CS.
- I'm exploring Deep Learning & Face Recognition right now. They both fascinate me a lot!
- I like participating in programming contests!(Though I'm far from being an expert)
- Now I'm learning CS231n ( so hard but I'm struggling on it !)
